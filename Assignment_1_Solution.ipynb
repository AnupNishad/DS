List - List is very flexible as the items in a list can have different data types.We can create list by just placing the sequence inside the square brackets[].\n           e.g l = [\"Hello\",2,78,2+3j,[1,2,3,4]]\n           We can access the list element by just providing index of an element like l[0],l[4]\n           \n   2. Tuple - Tuples are immutable i.e. tuples cannot be modified after it is created.We can create tuple by just placing the sequence inside the normal brackets().\n           e.g l = (\"Hello\",2,78,2+3j,(1,2,3,4))\n           We can access the list element by just providing index of an element like t[0],t[4]\n           \n   3. Dictionary - Dictionary holds key:value pair. Key-value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimized. Each key-value pair in a Dictionary is separated by a colon (:) & each key is separated by a ‘comma’.\n           e.g t = {\"Name\":\"Anup\",\"Age\":29,\"Address\":{\"Flat No.\":101,\"Building\":\"Oberoi Spring\"}}\n           We can access the dictiony key & values just by using its functions like d.keys(),d.values(),d.items()\n'''","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"07651d85-4055-47f9-ab5b-4d749e5f3dde"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Solution 4\n'''\n    An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and calls to functions.\n    The interpreter evaluates the expression and displays the result.\n'''","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"e4ef43e2-af93-4237-bef7-3eaa108c915c"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Solution 5\n'''\n    Below are the diff. between expression & statement\n    \n    Expression : \n                An Expression is a sequence or combination of values, variables, operators and function calls that always produces or returns a result value.\n                The evaluation of an expression does not changes state and produces at least one value as a result.\n        \n    Statement : \n                Any instruction that a python interpreter can execute is called a Statement.\n                The execution of a statement changes state.Execution of a statement may or may not produces or displays a result value, it only does whatever the statement says.\n                \n                Example given in question is spam = 10, here value 10 is assigning variable 'spam' is statement & its changing spam variable state but not showing result (only assigning)\n'''","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"e928be44-01c2-4237-b689-bbd99dfb01ca"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Solution 6\n'''\n    Variable bacon contain value as 22.\n'''","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"60d87f74-752c-4cb3-bd3d-2974b026f7cd"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Solution 7\n'''\n    Value of the following two terms are as follows\n    \n    'spam' + 'spamspam' = 'spamspamspam'\n    \n    'spam' * 3 = 'spamspamspam'\n    \n'''","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"7f576dd9-4419-445c-8b12-559b733fb244"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Solution 8\n'''\n    Variable names cannot begin with a number in python.\n    As 100 begins with integer number 1, therefore 100 is not valid variable\n    \n    If we add any alphabet before 100 then it would becomes valid variable e.g  - a100\n    \n'''","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"5d24714b-3217-4bde-bc40-cfabe8b72abc"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Solution 9\n'''\n    Following 3 functions can be use to get integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value : \n    \n    1. int()  - If we use int(100), it will provide 100 as integer output\n    2. float()  - If we use float(100), it will provide 100.0 as float output\n    3. str()  - If we use str(100), it will provide '100' as string output\n    \n'''","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"633e8065-daa4-4bc5-84ae-23473d9a013d"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Solution 10\n'''\n    Expression - 'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.' \n    \n    The above expression causing error because 99 is the integer value & above expression is trying to concatenate integer with string values.\n    \n    If we add 99 inside str() function as below, will fix the error\n        'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'\n    \n'''","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"b94da257-52c7-4c40-b848-960be0b5ae41"}]}
